# ObstacleCourseDemo
A simple demo make of an obstacle course game. The player can move around using 'WASD'. There are obstacles on the course including walls, rolling balls, and falling cubes. Hitting any of them resets you to the start. Reaching the end platform turns the platform green and represents the state when the would technically end. This was built using Unity and C#. Since it is a demo/test version of the features of such a game, there is no 'Win' state in the game. However, all the main features of such a game can be seen.

# Running the Game
The game can be run by going into the "Windows Playable Build" directory and running the executable file there. This build is only for a device run using the Windows operating system.
